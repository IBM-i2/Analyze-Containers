# Resetting your environment
Resetting the deployment after you complete one of the walkthroughs is done in 2 steps:

* Resets the configuration directory to the base example configuration
* Runs the deploy script to redeploy the system with the base configuration

## <a name="resettingtheconfiguration"></a> Resetting the configuration

The `configuration` directory is reset by calling the `createConfiguration.sh` script. This creates a clean configuration for your deployment.

## <a name="redeployingthesystem"></a> Redeploying the system

The `deploy.sh` script is run to redeploy the system.
