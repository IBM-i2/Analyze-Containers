# Understanding the walkthroughs

The walkthroughs are designed to demonstrate how you can configure and administer a deployment of i2 Analyze in a containerized environment.

The walkthroughs consist of scripts that you can run and a document to provide further explanation.

The walkthrough scripts use some of the server and client functions to reduce repetition. This is a pattern that can be copied and used in your own environment.

The list of walkthroughs that are provided is:
- [Adding a Solr node](./add_solr_node.md)
- [Updating the schema](./update_schema.md)
- [Updating the security schema](./update_security_schema.md)
- [Updating the i2 Analyze application configuration](./update_configuration.md)
- [Updating the system match rules](./update_match_rules.md)
- [Ingesting data](./ingestion.md)
- [Ingesting correlated data](./correlated_data.md)
- [Clearing data from a deployment](./clear_data.md)
